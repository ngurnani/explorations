# Explorations

This project contains a number of explorations of statistical ideas that I'm curious about. It is inspired in part by Peter Norvig's outstanding [Pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)
but is more focused on curiosity driven exploration rather than anything of practical interest.

To be entirely honest, it's as much driven by a pathological desire to find out if things that are claimed are indeed true.

My hope is that by making this repository public someone else may also benefit from my explorations.
