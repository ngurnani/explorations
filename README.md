# Fortune's Formula

This project contains a number of research simulations and
general ideas inspired by [Fortune's Formula by William Poundstone](https://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos-ebook/dp/B000SBTWNC).

All these ideas are inspired purely by curiosity rather than any practical interest. 

Lots of claims are made in the book and I have a pathological desire to find out if they are indeed true.

My hope is that making this repository public someone else also may benefit from my investigations.
